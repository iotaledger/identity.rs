# Domain Linkage

<Announcement/>

## Overview

Domain Linkage can provide proof for a connection between a DID and a domain being controlled by the same entity. This linkage can transfer trust from a domain to a DID and vice verca. For instance, if an entity trusts a domain, it can also trust the linked DID and all documents signed by verification methods included in the DID Document. A use case coud be a verifier that trusts `www.example.com` and receives a Verifiable Presentation issued by `did:foo:abc`. By `did:foo:abc` being linked to `www.example.com`, the verifier can trust that the Verifiable Presentation is issued by the same entity controlling `www.example.com`.
The DIF has approved a [Well Known DID Configuration](https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/) draft to standardize this connection by introducing the [DID Configuration Resource](https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/#did-configuration-resource) and the [Linked Domain Service Endpoint](https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/#linked-domain-service-endpoint).

### DID Configuration Resource

Suppose that a DID `did:foo:example` with the following DID Document only containing a `verificationMethod` `key-1`
```json
{
    "id": "did:foo:abc",
    "verificationMethod": [
      {
        "id": "did:foo:abc#key-1",
        "controller": "did:foo:abc",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
        "publicKeyMultibase": "zDShpHKXkcHKHcF8CnGAA1UqyyuEPRNz1XFEuggbWJQSq"
      }
    ]
  },
```

and the domain `https://www.example.com` represents the same entity and need be linked to increase trust in the DID.

To establish this linkage, A [DID Configuration Resource](https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/#did-configuration-resource) must be created and made available on the [DID Configuration URL](https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/#did-configuration-uri). In this case it's `https://example.com/.well-known/did-configuration.json`.


The [DID Configuration Resource](https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/#did-configuration-resource) is a JSON-LD object containing verifiable credentials called `Domain Linkage Credentials`. Each credential represents a linkage to a single DID.

:::note
Note that one `DID Configuration Resource` can include multiple `Domain Linkage Credentials` effectivaly linking the same domain to multiple DIDs.
:::


In this example, the domain `https://www.example.com` needs to be linked to the DID `did:foo:abc`. This means that the `DID Configuration Resource` will have one `Domain Linkage Credential`. This credential must have the following properties:

 - Its `type` includes `DomainLinkageCredential`. 
 - It includes the DID Configuration context.
 - The `credentialSubject` must be the DID `did:foo:abc` and references the domain `https://www.example.com`.
 - The issuer is the DID itself `did:foo:abc`.
 - It is signed by a key material included in the DID Document, in this case `did:foo:abc#key-1`.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://identity.foundation/.well-known/did-configuration/v1",
  "linked_dids": [
    {
      "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        "https://identity.foundation/.well-known/did-configuration/v1"
      ],
      "type": [
        "VerifiableCredential",
        "DomainLinkageCredential"
      ],
      "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:foo:abc",
        "origin": "https://www.example.com/"
      },
      "issuer": "did:foo:abc",
      "issuanceDate": "2023-02-09T22:14:15Z",
      "expirationDate": "2024-02-09T22:14:15Z",
      "proof": {
        "type": "JcsEd25519Signature2020",
        "verificationMethod": "did:foo:abc#key-1",
        "signatureValue": "4SvYqo3YoArfW7r7qKfN7RUJdZnBteb166KE4UkX8MNdbp5UW6YbykneAzvjyRmf5EVQ9bnP9cS5sbEPUn2uaAcB"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

Now this `DID Configuration Resource` must be made available on `https://example.com/.well-known/did-configuration.json` which establishes the  linkage.  

### Linked Domain Service Endpoint
By having a domain, one can discover what DIDs are linked to it by fetching the `DID Configuration Resource` and investigating the `Domain Linkage Credentials`. To enable discovery from the other direction, when having a DID and wanting to discover which domains are linked to it, a [Linked Domain Service Endpoint](https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/#linked-domain-service-endpoint) can be added to the DID Document. The DID Document from this example will be extended as follows to enable discovery of `https://www.example.com`: 

```json
{
    "id": "did:foo:abc",
    "verificationMethod": [
      {
        "id": "did:foo:abc#key-1",
        "controller": "did:foo:abc",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
        "publicKeyMultibase": "zDShpHKXkcHKHcF8CnGAA1UqyyuEPRNz1XFEuggbWJQSq"
      }
    ],
    "service": [
      {
        "id": "did:foo:abc#domain-linkage",
        "type": "LinkedDomains",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://www.example.com/"
      }
    ]
  }
```

:::note
Note that a DID Document can have multiple `Linked Domain Services` and each service can link to multiple domains.
:::

### Verifying DID and Domain Linkage

As mentioned above, the discovery of the Domain Linkage can happen from either direction. But verifying the linkage in both cases involves only verifying the DID Configuration Resource. The process is as follows:

1. Fetch `DID Configuration Resource` from `https://www.example.com/.well-known/did-configuration.json`.
2. Resolve the DID Document of `did:foo:abc`.
3. Verify the `DID Configuration Resource` and its `Domain Linkage Credential` that references `did:foo:abc`.

Here you can learn more about  [DID Configuration Resource Verification](https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/#did-configuration-resource-verification).
