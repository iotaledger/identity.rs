A [verifiable credential (VC)](./overview.mdx) can represent all information that a physical credential represents, such as a passport or university degree. However, by allowing other parties to cryptographically verify the authorship and integrity of the claims, verifiable credentials can be seen as more tamper-evident and more trustworthy than their physical counterparts.

In the IOTA Identity Framework you can create a Verifiable Credential with the following properties:

- [**Context**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#contexts): list of JSON-LD context URIs. Includes `"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"` by default.
- [**Types**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#types): list of types describing the credential. Includes `"VerifiableCredential"` by default.
- [**Subject**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credential-subject): the claims of the issuer; a set of objects that contain one or more properties that are each related to a subject.
- [**Issuer**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuer): the identifier of the issuer, typically their DID.
- [**ID**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#identifiers): optional URI identifier for the credential.
- [**Issuance Date**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuance-date): optional timestamp for expressing the date and time when a credential becomes valid. 
- [**Expiration Date**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#expiration): optional timestamp for expressing the date and time when a credential ceases to be valid.
- [**Status**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#status): optional information used to determine the current status of a credential, i.e. whether or not it has been [revoked](./revocation.mdx).
- [**Schema**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#data-schemas): optional list of objects specifying the schema that the data must conform to. 
- [**Refresh Service**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#refreshing): optional link to a service where the recipient may refresh the included credentials.
- [**Terms of Use**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#terms-of-use): optional list of policies defining obligations, prohibitions, or permissions of the presentation recipient.
- [**Evidence**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#evidence): optional list of objects that can be used by the issuer to provide the verifier with additional supporting information in a verifiable credential.
- [**Non-Transferable**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#nontransferable-property): optional flag that indicates that a verifiable credential must only be encapsulated in a [verifiable presentation](./verifiable_presentations.mdx) whose proof was issued by the credential subject.

## Signing {#signing}

After creation, the issuer signs the verifiable credential using one of their private keys, embedding the digital signature in its [proof](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#proofs-signatures) section. This is what allows verifiers to independently validate the credential using the corresponding public key from the issuer's DID Document.

### Proof Options {#proof-options}

A digital signature on a verifiable credential both provides data integrity and proves the DID of the issuer.
The proof section embedded in a credential may also include additional metadata.

The following metadata properties can be configured by the framework and are optional and omitted by default:

- **Created**: timestamp of when the credential was signed, recommended.
- **Expires**: timestamp after which the signature is no longer considered valid. Implementers should prefer to set the dedicated **Expiration Date** property on credentials instead.
- **Proof Purpose**: indicates the purpose of the signature.
  - **AssertionMethod**: to assert a claim. The signing verification method must have an [`assertionMethod`](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#assertion) relationship to be valid.
  - **Authentication**: to authenticate the signer. The signing verification method must have an [`authentication`](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#authentication) relationship to be valid.

Most verifiable credentials should be signed with the assertion method proof purpose to clearly indicate that the signature is asserting a claim and restrict it to valid verification methods. Whereas a proof may be attached to a [verifiable presentation](./verifiable_presentations.mdx) for authentication purposes. 

Other metadata fields such as `challenge` and `domain` may be included, however they are more pertinent for [verifiable presentations](./verifiable_presentations.mdx).

## Validation {#validation}

Verifiers should ensure certain properties of a credential are valid when receiving one or more in a [verifiable presentation](./verifiable_presentations.mdx). Both issuers and holders may also wish to validate their credentials, particularly directly after creating or receiving one. Validation may be performed at any point in time and can be a useful way of checking whether a credential has expired or been revoked. 

The IOTA Identity Framework supports the following checks during credential validation:

- **Semantic structure**: ensures the credential adheres to the specification.
- **Proof**: verifies the signature against the DID Document of the issuer.
- **Optional validations**: additional checks on credential properties and the signature can be configured by specifying [Validation Options](#validation-options).

### Validation Options {#validation-options}

These options specify conditions that specific properties in a credential must satisfy.

- **Expiry Date**: check that the [`expirationDate`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#expiration) property, if present, is not before a specific datetime. Defaults to the current datetime if unset.
- **Issuance Date**: check that that [`issuanceDate`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuance-date) property, if present, is not after a specific datetime. Defaults to the current datetime if unset.
- **Verifier Options**: validates aspects of the credential signature and its metadata, see [Proof Options](#proof-options).

### Sharing Verifiable Credentials {#sharing-verifiable-credentials}

A [verifiable presentation](./verifiable_presentations.mdx) is the recommended data format for sharing one or more verifiable credentials, as it provides cryptographic means of proving the DID of the holder presenting them, and for enforcing [subject-holder relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#subject-holder-relationships). See the [Verifiable Presentations](./verifiable_presentations.mdx) page for further detail.

## Example

The following code exemplifies how an issuer can create, sign, and validate a verifiable credential. In this example, the issuer signs a UniversityDegreeCredential with Alice's name and DID. 
This Verifiable Credential can be [verified by anyone](./verifiable_presentations.mdx), allowing Alice to take control of it and share it with anyone.
