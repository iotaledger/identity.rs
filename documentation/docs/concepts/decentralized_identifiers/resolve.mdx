DID resolution is the process of fetching a [DID Document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents) corresponding to a given [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers).
The [IOTA Identity Framework](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs) supports resolving DID Documents that are stored on an IOTA Tangle (public or private). The main tool supplied
by the IOTA Identity Framework to handle DID Document resolution in a type safe manner is the `Resolver`. A DID Resolver as defined in the [W3C Decentralized Identifiers specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-resolvers)
enforces the signature of the resolution function in a manner that is more centered around Web/API resolution rather than a strongly typed framework. This is the reason why the `Resolver` provided by the IOTA Identity Framework deviates somewhat from
the W3C specification.


## Resolving a DID from the main network
The following example demonstrates how to resolve the DID: "did:iota:H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV" from the `main` network.
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Rust" label="Rust">

```rust
use identity_iota::client::Resolver;
use identity_iota::iota_core::IotaDID;
use identity_iota::client::ResolvedIotaDocument;

let resolver: Resolver = Resolver::new().await?;
let did: IotaDID = IotaDID::parse("did:iota:H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV")?;

let doc: ResolvedIotaDocument = resolver.resolve(&did).await?;

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

```js
const {
    DID,
    Resolver,
    ResolvedDocument,
} = require('@iota/identity-wasm/node');

 const resolver = new Resolver();
 const did = DID.parse("did:iota:H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV");
 const doc = await resolver.resolve(did);

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
What happens in this example can be explained on a high level as follows: The Resolver queries the Tangle for the history of the DID Document and utilizes it to recreate and validate the latest state of the DID Document.

## Resolving from a private tangle
Resolving a DID from a private tangle is similar to resolving a DID from the main net. The only difference is that
the resolver needs to be configured to have a client capable of operating on said private tangle. Building a `Client` configured for a specified Tangle is explained in [this example in Rust](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/blob/support/v0.6/examples/low-level-api/private_tangle.rs) and [this example in Javascript](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/blob/support/v0.6/bindings/wasm/examples/src/private_tangle.js).

The following example demonstrates how one can setup a `Resolver` with a given `client` and then attempt resolving a specified `did` which may be on any Tangle (public or private).
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Rust" label="Rust">

```rust
use identity_iota::client::Resolver;
use identity_iota::client::ResolverBuilder;
use identity_iota::iota_core::IotaDID;
use identity_iota::client::Client;
use identity_iota::client::Result;


async fn build_and_resolve(client: Client, did: IotaDID) -> Result<ResolvedIotaDocument> {
    let resolver_builder: ResolverBuilder = ResolverBuilder::new().await?;
    let resolver: Resolver = resolver_builder.client(client).build().await?;
    resolver.resolve(did).await
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

```js
const {
    DID,
    Resolver,
    ResolvedDocument,
    Client,
} = require('@iota/identity-wasm/node');


async function buildAndResolve(client, did) {
        const resolver = await Resolver.builder().client(client).build();
        const resolvedDocument = await resolver.resolve(did);
        return resolvedDocument;
}

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the example above the resolver will automatically try to resolve the DID from the network specified in the `did` (See [DID Format](../../specs/did/iota_did_method_spec#did-format)).
If the resolver was not built with a client configured for the given network name then an error will be thrown. Note that the `ResolverBuilder` can configure the `Resolver` to use
multiple networks as long as they have distinct valid names (max six characters).

Note that in the context of an identity managed by an `Account` the DID document can also be resolved by simply calling the `resolve` method on the `Account` directly.

## Resolution in the context of Verifiable Presentations
As explained in [Verifiable Presentations](./../verifiable_credentials/verifiable_presentations) one resolves the DID Documents of the credential issuers and presentation holder
during verification of a verifiable presentation. Resolving the necessary DID Documents is done automatically when verifying presentations via the `Resolver`, but there are certain
advanced use cases where more control is desired. To accommodate for such situations the `Resolver` also comes equipped with additional stand alone methods that enable:
- resolving a presentation holder's DID Document
- resolving all DID Documents of the distinct issuers of the credentials contained in the presentation
- resolving the issuer's DID Document for a given verifiable credential


## Resolving the history of a DID Document.
The fact that a DID Document [can be updated](./update.mdx) implies that the state of the DID Document can change over time, or in other words the result of resolving a DID
also depends on when this operation was carried out. The `Resolver` provides a way to view the entire history of a DID Document (up to the time when the method is called).

```rust
use identity_iota::client::Resolver;
use identity_iota::iota_core::IotaDID;
use identity_iota::client::DocumentHistory;
use identity_iota::client::Result;


async fn call_resolve_history(did: IotaDID) -> Result<DocumentHistory> {
    let resolver: Resolver = Resolver::new().await?;
    resolver.resolve_history(did).await?
}

        const resolver = new Resolver();
        const documentHistory = await resolver.resolveHistory(did);
        return documentHistory;
}

```

## Complete examples
This section shows complete examples from the Iota Identity Framework code base. The first example creates a DID Document, publishes it to the Tangle and then resolves it.

<CodeSnippet
    nodeReplitLink="https://repl.it/@IOTAFoundation/resolve-did?lite=true"
    rustContent={resolve_did_rs}
    nodeGithubLink = "https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/blob/support/v0.6/bindings/wasm/examples/src/resolve_did.js"
    rustGithubLink = "https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/blob/support/v0.6/examples/low-level-api/resolve_did.rs"
/>


This second example demonstrates creating, publishing changes and then resolving the history of a DID Document.

Note that this example used the `Client` to resolve the history of the DID Document, but one could also use the `Resolver` for this task.
