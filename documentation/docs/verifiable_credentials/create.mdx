TODO: Explain how a VC is created and verified.

## Example

This example shows how you can create a Verifiable Credential and validate it. In this example, Alice takes the role of the subject, while we also have an issuer.
The issuer signs a UniversityDegreeCredential type verifiable credential with Alice's name and DID.
This Verifiable Credential can be verified by anyone, allowing Alice to take control of it and share it with anyone.
