[dependencies]
identity = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs", branch = "main"}
```

### Development Release

This version matches the `dev` branch of this repository. It has all the **latest features**, but as such it **may also have undocumented breaking changes**.

```rust
[dependencies]
identity = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs", branch = "dev"}
```

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs
