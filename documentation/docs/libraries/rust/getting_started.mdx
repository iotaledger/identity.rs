## Include the Library

To include IOTA Identity in your project add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

### Latest Stable Release

This version is published to crates.io and is **stable**, following semantic versioning.

```toml
[dependencies]
identity_iota = { version = "0.7.0-alpha" }
```

### Development Release

This version matches the `main` branch of this repository. It has all the **latest features**, but as such it **may also have undocumented breaking changes**.

```toml
[dependencies]
identity_iota = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs", branch = "main"}
```


## Examples

To try out the [examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/tree/main/examples), you should:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs
```
2. Build the repository:

```bash
cargo build
```
3. Run your first example:

```bash
cargo run --example getting_started
```

## API Reference

The API reference for the Rust library can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/identity_iota/latest/identity_iota/index.html).

If you would like to build the documentation locally you can do so with the following command:

```
RUSTDOCFLAGS='--cfg docsrs' cargo +nightly doc -p identity_iota --all-features --no-deps --open
```
