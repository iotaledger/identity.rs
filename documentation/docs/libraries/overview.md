While the framework itself is developed in the Rust programming language, we also provide bindings, or "Foreign Function Interfaces" (FFI), to other languages.

For the Rust implementation see the [Rust Getting Started](./rust/getting_started).

For the Wasm bindings see the [Wasm Getting Started](./wasm/getting_started).
