If you want to benefit from Self-Sovereign Identity, you need to create a [Decentralized Identity](../concepts/decentralized_identifiers/overview.md). This identity consists of many parts that have different functions. This page will cover the basics about identity creation and publishing.

## Identity Generation Process
1. The generation of an identity requires a address with funds to cover the [Storage Deposit](../concepts/decentralized_identifiers/alias.md#storage-deposit). In test networks, a faucet can be used to request funds.
2. Create the content of the DID Document, a minimal document contains one verification method.
3. Construct a new [Alias Output](../concepts/decentralized_identifiers/alias.md) that includes the DID Document in the [State Metadata](../concepts/decentralized_identifiers/alias.md).
4. Publish the generated Alias Output.

The DID is only known once the [Alias Output](../concepts/decentralized_identifiers/alias.md) is successfully published, since the DID's [Tag](../specs/did/iota_did_method_spec.md#iota-tag) contains the [Alias ID](../concepts/decentralized_identifiers/alias.md#alias-id).

See the example below to create an identity in Rust or Node.js.

As this page is a simple overview about creating an identity, further wiki pages are available for more in-depth explanation. Note that the Iota Identity Framework follows [IOTA DID Method Specification](../specs/did/iota_did_method_spec.md).
