While IOTA Identity implements many existing standards, it also adds some additional features we would like to standardize ourselves. This chapter covers these features and how they work in great detail. These are not light reads and can be skipped.

The current specification are:

- [IOTA DIDComm](./didcomm/overview.mdx): A collection of DIDComm protocols for common SSI interactions
