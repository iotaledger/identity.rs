The IOTA DIDComm Specification is in the RFC phase and may undergo changes. Suggestions are welcome at [GitHub #464](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/discussions/464).

[Problem reports](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#problem-reports) are a standard [DIDComm](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/) feature for reporting errors or warnings between parties. Using this mechanism is not a general requirement but it is a best practice for relaying informative errors and may improve human experience.

## Example

A problem report is a standard DIDComm message:

```json
{
  "type": "https://didcomm.org/report-problem/2.0/problem-report",
  "id": "7c9de639-c51c-4d60-ab95-103fa613c805",
  "pthid": "1e513ad4-48c9-444e-9e7e-5b8b45c5e325",
  "body": {
    "code": "e.p.xfer.cant-use-endpoint",
    "comment": "Unable to use the {1} endpoint for {2}.",
    "args": [
      "https://agents.r.us/inbox",
      "did:sov:C805sNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg"
    ],
    "escalate_to": "mailto:admin@foo.org"
  }
}
```

Note that problem reports may still use [sender authenticated encryption](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#sender-authenticated-encryption) or even be [signed DIDComm messages](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#didcomm-signed-message).

## IOTA Problem Codes

We follow the notation for [problem codes defined by the DIDComm specification](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging/blob/84e5a7c66c87440d39e93df81e4440855273f987/docs/spec-files/problems.md#problem-codes). In general, we use the error sorter `e` and protocol scope `p` to indicate that problem reports result in the abandonment of a protocol. 

In addition to the [problem report descriptors in the DIDComm specification](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging/blob/84e5a7c66c87440d39e93df81e4440855273f987/docs/spec-files/problems.md#descriptors), we define the following non-exhaustive list of general problem report codes that may be sent during the course of any protocol:

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `e.p.msg.invalid-message` | The message is malformed or fails field constraints validation. |
| `e.p.msg.unsupported-message` | The message type is unrecognised or unsupported by the recipient. |
| `e.p.msg.invalid-state` | The recipient is unable to handle the type of message in its current state. Typically when an unexpected message is received in the middle of a protocol on the same thread. |
| `e.p.msg.trust.not-authenticated` | The sender is required to authenticate to perform the requested action. | 
| `e.p.msg.trust.not-authorised` | The sender is authenticated but lacks sufficient permissions to perform the requested action. | 
| `e.p.msg.trust.not-sender-authenticated` | The recipient requires the message to use [sender authenticated encryption](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#sender-authenticated-encryption). | 
| `e.p.msg.trust.not-encrypted` | The recipient requires the message to use [anonymous encryption](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#anonymous-encryption) | 
| `e.p.msg.trust.not-signed` | The recipient requires a [signed DIDComm message](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#didcomm-signed-message). | 
| `e.p.msg.trust.crypto` | Any general cryptography-related error. E.g. the signature in a message payload or on a [signed DIDComm message](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#didcomm-signed-message) fails validation, or [sender authenticated encryption](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#sender-authenticated-encryption) fails. |
| `e.p.req.time` | The party has timed out waiting for a response. |

These messages may be raised during or between protocols to inform the other party that something went wrong. A problem report with the error sorter `e` and protocol scope `p` terminates the protocol on the current thread and MAY be followed by a connection [termination](../protocols/termination.mdx).

## Unresolved Questions
- Should we support the message scope `m` to allow resending / retrying individual messages?
