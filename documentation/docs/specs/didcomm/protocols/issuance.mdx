The IOTA DIDComm Specification is in the RFC phase and may undergo changes. Suggestions are welcome at [GitHub #464](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/discussions/464).

:::

- Version: 0.1
- Status: `IN-PROGRESS`
- Last Updated: 2021-10-29

## Overview

Allows a [holder](#roles) to request a [verifiable credential][VC] from an [issuer](#roles). The [issuer](#roles) may alternatively initiate the issuance without a request from the [holder](#roles). This protocol also allows the [issuer](#roles) to request additional information and to offload the actual signing to a different party.

### Relationships
- [Presentation](./presentation.mdx): the [issuer](#roles) may request a [verifiable presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0) from the [holder](#roles) during the course of this protocol if additional information is required.
- [Signing](./signing.mdx): the [issuer](#roles) may delegate signing to another [issuer](#roles) if they lack the needed authority or private key, in which case the [issuer](#roles) takes on the role of [trusted-party](./signing.mdx#roles).

### Example Use-Cases

- A university issues a degree to a graduate that can be verified by potential employers.
- A resident requests proof of address from their city council.
- An insurer issues proof that a company has liability insurance.

### Roles
- [Holder](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders): stores one or more verifiable credentials. A holder is usually but not always the [subject][SUBJECT] of those credentials.
- [Issuer](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-issuers): creates verifiable credentials asserting claims about one or more [subjects][SUBJECT], transmitted to a holder.

## Messages

### 1. issuance-request {#issuance-request}

- Type: `iota/issuance/0.1/issuance-request`
- Role: [holder](#roles)

The [holder](#roles) requests a single verifiable credential from the [issuer](#roles) of a particular kind.

#### Structure
```json
{
  "subject": DID,                   // REQUIRED
  "credentialInfo": CredentialInfo, // REQUIRED
}
```

| Field | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [`subject`][SUBJECT] | [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) of the [credential subject][SUBJECT][^1]. | ✔ |
| `credentialInfo` | A [CredentialInfo](../resources/credential-info.mdx) object, specifying a credential kind requested by the [holder](#roles).[^2] [^3] [^4] | ✔ |

[^1] The [holder](#roles) is usually but not always the [subject][SUBJECT] of the requested credential. There may be custodial, legal guardianship, or delegation situations where a third-party requests, or is issued a credential on behalf of a subject. It is the responsibility of the [issuer](#roles) to ensure authorization in such cases.

[^2] The `credentialInfo` could be hard-coded, communicated in-band, discovered out-of-band, or be pre-sent by an [issuer](#roles). The [issuer](#roles) SHOULD reject the request with a `problem-report` if it does not support the requested `credentialInfo`.

[^3] With [CredentialType2021], the `type` MAY be under-specified if the exact type is unknown or if the resulting type depends on the identity or information of the subject or holder. E.g. the `type` could be as general as `["VerifiableCredential"]` if the issuer issues only a singular type of credential or decides the credential based on other information related to the subject. 

[^4] With [CredentialType2021], the [holder](#roles) MAY specify one or more trusted issuers they would like to sign the resulting credential. The [issuer](#roles) SHOULD reject the request with a `problem-report` if it supports none of the requested `issuer` entries. However, there are circumstances where an `issuer` is no longer supported or was compromised, so this behavior should be decided based on the application.

An [issuer](#roles) wanting to preserve privacy regarding which exact credential kinds, types, or issuers they support should be careful with the information they disclose in `problem-reports` when rejecting requests. E.g. a `problem-report` with only a `reject-request` descriptor discloses less information than the `reject-request.invalid-type` or `reject-request.invalid-trusted-issuer` descriptors, as the latter two could be used to determine supported types or signing issuers by process of elimination.

#### Examples

1. Request any drivers licence credential using [CredentialType2021]:

```json
{
  "subject": "did:example:c6ef1fe11eb22cb711e6e227fbc",
  "credentialInfo": {
    "credentialInfoType": "CredentialType2021",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "DriversLicence"],
  }
}
```

2. Request a university degree credential from either supported trusted issuer using [CredentialType2021]:

```json
{
  "subject": "did:example:c6ef1fe11eb22cb711e6e227fbc",
  "credentialInfo": {
    "credentialInfoType": "CredentialType2021",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "UniversityDegreeCredential", "BachelorOfArtsDegreeCredential"],
    "issuer": ["did:example:76e12ec712ebc6f1c221ebfeb1f", "did:example:f1befbe122c1f6cbe217ce21e67"]
  }
}
```

### 2. issuance-offer {#issuance-offer}

- Type: `iota/issuance/0.1/issuance-offer`
- Role: [issuer](#roles)

The [issuer](#roles) offers a single, unsigned credential to the [holder](#roles), matching the preceding [`issuance-request`](#issuance-request) if present. The [issuer](#roles) may set an expiry date for the offer and require non-repudiable proof by the [holder](#roles) that the offer was received.

#### Structure
```json
{
  "unsignedCredential": Credential, // REQUIRED
  "offerChallenge": {
    "challenge": string,            // REQUIRED
    "credentialHash": string,       // REQUIRED
  }, // OPTIONAL
  "offerExpiry": DateTime           // OPTIONAL
}
```

| Field | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [`unsignedCredential`][VC] | Unsigned [credential][VC] being offered to the [holder](#roles). This MUST NOT include a `proof` section. | ✔ |
| `offerChallenge` | If present, indicates the [issuer](#issuer) requires the acceptance of the credential to be signed by the [holder](#holder) in the following [issuance-response](#issuance-response) for non-repudiation.[^1] | ✖ |
| `challenge` |  A random string that should be unique per [issuance-offer](#issuance-offer). | ✔ |
| `credentialHash` | The [Base58](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-msporny-base58-01.html)-encoded [SHA-256 digest](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4634) of the `unsignedCredential` formatted according to the [JSON Canonicalization Scheme](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-rundgren-json-canonicalization-scheme-00.html). | ✔ |
| `offerExpiry` | A string formatted as an [XML DateTime](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dateTime) normalized to UTC 00:00:00 and without sub-second decimal precision. E.g: `"2021-12-30T19:17:47Z"`.[^2] | ✖ |

[^1] Issuing challenges should be done with due consideration to security and privacy concerns: not all applications require non-repudiation to third-parties and a [holder](#roles) [may wish to deny that they ever requested or accepted a particular credential](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0049-repudiation/README.md#summary). The challenge SHOULD NOT be used for authentication of the [holder](#roles); see the [authentication](./authentication.mdx) protocol and [sender authenticated encryption](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#sender-authenticated-encryption).

[^2] If present, an `offerExpiry` indicates that the [issuer](#roles) MAY rescind the offer and abandon the protocol if an affirmative [issuance-response](#issuance-response) is not received before the specified datetime. Note that the `offerExpiry` should override any default message timeouts.

#### Examples

1. Offer a degree credential:

```json
{
 "unsignedCredential": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
    ],
    "id": "6c1a1477-e452-4da7-b2db-65ad0b369d1a",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "UniversityDegreeCredential"],
    "issuer": "did:example:76e12ec712ebc6f1c221ebfeb1f",
    "issuanceDate": "2021-05-03T19:73:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
      "degree": {
        "type": "BachelorDegree",
        "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. A time-limited offer for a degree credential with a signature requested:

```json
{
 "unsignedCredential": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
    ],
    "id": "6c1a1477-e452-4da7-b2db-65ad0b369d1a",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "UniversityDegreeCredential"],
    "issuer": "did:example:76e12ec712ebc6f1c221ebfeb1f",
    "issuanceDate": "2021-01-05T19:37:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
      "degree": {
        "type": "BachelorDegree",
        "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
      }
    }
  },
  "offerChallenge": {
    "challenge": "d7b7869e-fec3-4de9-84bb-c3a43bacff33",
    "credentialHash": "28Ae7AdqzyMyF9pmnwUNK1Q7VT3EzDDGEj1Huk7uYQT94KYAhQzEPyhoF5Ugs3totUugLPpghGmE9HaG8usJZcZv",
  },
  "offerExpiry": "2021-01-05T20:07:24Z"
}
```

### 3. issuance-response {#issuance-response}

- Type: `iota/issuance/0.1/issuance-response`
- Role: [holder](#roles)

The [holder](#roles) responds to a [`issuance-offer`](#issuance-offer) by accepting or disputing the offer and optionally signing the response for non-repudiation.

#### Structure
```json
{
  "accepted": bool,             // REQUIRED
  "disputes": [Dispute],        // OPTIONAL
  "signature": {
    "offerChallenge": {
      "challenge": string,      // REQUIRED
      "credentialHash": string, // REQUIRED
    }, // REQUIRED
    "proof": Proof,             // REQUIRED
  } // OPTIONAL
}
```

| Field | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `accepted` | Indicates if the [holder](#roles) accepts the offered credential from [`issuance-offer`](#issuance-offer). MUST be `false` if any `disputes` are present. | ✔ |
| [`disputes`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#disputes) | Allows the [holder](#roles) to [`dispute`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#disputes) one or more claims in the credential. | ✖ |
| `signature` | This SHOULD be present if a `offerChallenge` was included in the preceding [`issuance-offer`](#issuance-offer).[^1] | ✖ |
| `offerChallenge` | This MUST match the `offerChallenge` in the preceding [`issuance-offer`](#issuance-offer). | ✔ |
| [`proof`](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/) | Signature of the [holder](#roles) on the `offerChallenge`. | ✔ |

[^1] A valid `signature` allows the [issuer](#roles) to prove that the credential was accepted by the [holder](#roles). If present, the [issuer](#roles) MUST validate the `proof` is correct and signed with an unrevoked [verification method](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verification-method), and issue a problem-report if not. The [issuer](#roles) SHOULD terminate the protocol if no `signature` is present and a `offerChallenge` was included in the preceding [issuance-offer](#issuance-offer) message. An explicit `signature` is used instead of a [signed DIDComm message](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#didcomm-signed-message) to avoid the need to store the entire credential for auditing purposes; the hash is sufficient to prove a particular credential was accepted.

#### Examples

1. Accept a credential offer:

```json
{
  "accepted": true,
  "disputes": [],
}
```

2. Accept a credential offer including a signature:

```json
{
  "accepted": true,
  "disputes": [],
  "signature": {
    "offerChallenge": {
      "challenge": "d7b7869e-fec3-4de9-84bb-c3a43bacff33",
      "credentialHash": "28Ae7AdqzyMyF9pmnwUNK1Q7VT3EzDDGEj1Huk7uYQT94KYAhQzEPyhoF5Ugs3totUugLPpghGmE9HaG8usJZcZv",
    },
    "proof": {...}
  }
}
```

3. Reject a credential offer with disputes:

```json
{
  "accepted": false,
  "disputes": [{
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    ],
    "id": "6e8e989e-749e-4ed8-885b-b2a2bb64835f",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "DisputeCredential"],
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "6c1a1477-e452-4da7-b2db-65ad0b369d1a",
      "currentStatus": "Disputed",
      "statusReason": {
        "value": "Incorrect name.",
        "lang": "en"
      },
    },
    "issuer": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
    "issuanceDate": "2021-01-05T19:46:24Z",
    "proof": {...}
  }],
}
```

### 4. issuance {#issuance-message}

- Type: `iota/issuance/0.1/issuance`
- Role: [issuer](#roles)

The [issuer](#roles) transmits the signed credential following a [`issuance-response`](#issuance-response) by the [holder](#roles). The [issuer](#roles) may set an expiry until when they expect an acknowledgment and request a cryptographic signature in the acknowledgment for non-repudiation. 

#### Structure
```json
{
  "signedCredential": Credential,   // REQUIRED
  "issuanceChallenge": {
    "challenge": string,            // REQUIRED
    "credentialHash": string,       // REQUIRED
  }, // OPTIONAL
  "issuanceExpiry": DateTime,       // OPTIONAL
}
```

| Field | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [`signedCredential`][VC] | [Verifiable credential][VC] signed by the [issuer](#roles).[^1] | ✔ |
| `issuanceChallenge` | If present, indicates the [issuer](#issuer) requires the [issuance-acknowledgement](#issuance-acknowledgement) of the credential to be signed for non-repudiation. | ✖ |
| `challenge` |  A random string that should be unique per [issuance](#issuance). | ✔ |
| `credentialHash` | The [Base58](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-msporny-base58-01.html)-encoded [SHA-256 digest](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4634) of the `signedCredential`, including the `proof`, formatted according to the [JSON Canonicalization Scheme](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-rundgren-json-canonicalization-scheme-00.html). | ✔ |
| `issuanceExpiry` | A string formatted as an [XML Datetime](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dateTime) normalized to UTC 00:00:00 and without sub-second decimal precision indicating when the offer expires. E.g: `"2021-12-30T19:17:47Z"`.[^2] | ✖ |

[^1] The [holder](#roles) SHOULD validate both that the `proof` on the `signedCredential` is correctly signed by a trusted issuer and that the contents match those of the `unsignedCredential` from the [issuance-offer](#issuance-offer) they accepted. If not, a relevant problem-report should be sent.

[^2] The [issuer](#roles) SHOULD send a problem-report if the `issuanceExpiry` datetime passes without receiving an [issuance-acknowledgement](#issuance-acknowledgement) message from the [holder](#roles). The [issuer](#roles) MAY revoke the credential in this case.

#### Examples

1. Issuing a credential including expiry and requesting proof:

```json
{
 "unsignedCredential": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
    ],
    "id": "6c1a1477-e452-4da7-b2db-65ad0b369d1a",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "UniversityDegreeCredential"],
    "issuer": "did:example:76e12ec712ebc6f1c221ebfeb1f",
    "issuanceDate": "2021-01-05T19:37:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
      "degree": {
        "type": "BachelorDegree",
        "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
      }
    },
    "proof": {
      "type": "JcsEd25519Signature2020",
      "verificationMethod": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21#key",
      "signatureValue": "3KpeHSW4LybMy1smFEYriRmj5FsFfnxQiEsBnQdYzwkXMnjF3Jjn5RS1KGzheNpUgHW5yua8DoLbfYmZFAvaUVwv"
    }
  },
  "issuanceChallenge": {
    "challenge": "6ff5f616-2f9c-4e47-b9d2-5553deeac01d",
    "credentialHash": "21DtABsnYNb7oGEY8aybb9Bghq6NJJWvrQgtC2SBdhgQ8v6cZGjnT8RmEmBLZfHyfEYMAik3D1EoNQZCaT4RUKEX",
  },
  "issuanceExpiry": "2021-01-05T20:07:24Z"
}
```

### 5. issuance-acknowledgment {#issuance-acknowledgment}

- Type: `iota/issuance/0.1/issuance-acknowledgment`
- Role: [holder](#roles)

The [holder](#roles) confirms receipt of a successful credential [`issuance`](#issuance-message), optionally including non-repudiable proof.

#### Structure
```json
{
  "signature": {
    "issuanceChallenge": {
      "challenge": string,      // REQUIRED
      "credentialHash": string, // REQUIRED
    }, // REQUIRED
    "proof": Proof,             // REQUIRED
  } // OPTIONAL
}
```

| Field | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `signature` | This SHOULD be present if a `issuanceChallenge` was included in the preceding [`issuance`](#issuance-message) message.[^1] | ✖ |
| `issuanceChallenge` | This MUST match the `issuanceChallenge` in the preceding [`issuance`](#issuance-message) message. | ✔ |
| [`proof`](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/) | Signature of the [holder](#roles) on the `issuanceChallenge`. | ✔ |

[^1] The [issuer](#roles) MUST validate the `signature` and MAY revoke the issued credential if a `signature` was requested, e.g. for non-repudiation or auditing, and not received or an invalid `signature` is received. An explicit `signature` is used instead of a [signed DIDComm message](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#didcomm-signed-message) to avoid the need to store the entire credential for auditing purposes as the hash is sufficient to prove a particular credential was accepted.

#### Examples

1. Acknowledge receipt of the credential:

```json
{}
```

2. Acknowledge receipt of the credential including a signature:

```json
{
  "signature": {
    "issuanceChallenge": {
      "challenge": "6ff5f616-2f9c-4e47-b9d2-5553deeac01d",
      "credentialHash": "21DtABsnYNb7oGEY8aybb9Bghq6NJJWvrQgtC2SBdhgQ8v6cZGjnT8RmEmBLZfHyfEYMAik3D1EoNQZCaT4RUKEX",
    },
    "proof": {...}
  }
}
```

### Problem Reports {#problem-reports}

The following problem-report codes may be raised in the course of this protocol and are expected to be recognised and handled in addition to any general problem-reports. Implementers may also introduce their own application-specific problem-reports.

For guidance on problem-reports and a list of general codes see [problem reports](../resources/problem-reports.mdx).

| Code | Message | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `e.p.msg.iota.issuance.reject-request` | [issuance-request](#issuance-request) | [Issuer](#roles) rejects a credential request for any reason, e.g. unrecognised or invalid type, trusted issuer, or subject. |
| `e.p.msg.iota.issuance.reject-request.invalid-subject` | [issuance-request](#issuance-request) | [Issuer](#roles) rejects a credential request due to the `subject` being unrecognised, missing, or otherwise invalid. |
| `e.p.msg.iota.issuance.reject-request.invalid-type` | [issuance-request](#issuance-request) | [Issuer](#roles) rejects a credential request due to the `type` or `@context` being unsupported or otherwise invalid. |
| `e.p.msg.iota.issuance.reject-request.invalid-issuer` | [issuance-request](#issuance-request) | [Issuer](#roles) rejects a credential request due to `trustedIssuers` being unrecognised, unsupported or otherwise invalid. |
| `e.p.msg.iota.issuance.presentation-failed` | [issuance-offer](#issuance-offer) | [Issuer](#roles) terminates the protocol due to a failed [presentation](./presentation.mdx) request for more information prior to a [issuance-offer](#issuance-offer). |
| `e.p.msg.iota.issuance.reject-response.missing-signature` | [issuance-response](#issuance-response) | [Issuer](#roles) rejects an [issuance-response](#issuance-response) missing a `signature` when `offerChallenge` was included in the preceding [issuance-offer](#issuance-offer) message. |
| `e.p.msg.iota.issuance.reject-issuance` | [issuance](#issuance-message) | [Holder](#roles) rejects a credential issuance for any reason, e.g. mismatch with the credential in the [issuance-offer](#issuance-offer). Note that disputes are handled in [issuance-response](#issuance-response) prior to [issuance](#issuance-message). |
| `e.p.msg.iota.issuance.expired` | [issuance](#issuance-message) | [Issuer](#roles) notifies the [holder](#roles) that an [issuance](#issuance-message) message has expired without a valid [issuance-acknowledgement](#issuance-acknowledgement). |
| `e.p.msg.iota.issuance.reject-acknowledgement.missing-signature` | [issuance-acknowledgement](#issuance-acknowledgement) | [Issuer](#roles) rejects an [issuance-acknowledgement](#issuance-acknowledgement) missing a `signature` when `issuanceChallenge` was included in the preceding [issuance](#issuance-message) message. |

## Unresolved Questions

- The `credentialSubject::id` field of a verifiable credential is optional and not always a DID according to the [verifiable credential specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model). Should we enforce that it is always a DID? This affects presentations are noted in the [subject-holder relationships section of the specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#subject-holder-relationships). We essentially enforce the [`nonTransferable` property](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#nontransferable-property) for all credentials in our presentations currently to prevent verifiers storing and re-presenting credentials as their own.

- `e.p.msg.iota.issuance.reject-request.invalid-type` and `e.p.msg.iota.issuance.reject-request.invalid-issuer` are specific to [CredentialType2021]. Should they be listed here? If yes, should they be marked accordingly?
