## Overview

Indicates the graceful termination of a connection. It is expected that no reconnection attempt will be made on any of the message thread/s in this connection following termination. This provides a chance for the receiver to clean up or archive any resources allocated to the connection.

### Relationships

- [Connection](./connection.mdx): this protocol terminates a communication initiated by the [connection protocol](./connection.mdx).

### Example Use-Cases

- A verifier terminates the connection following a successful presentation from a holder.
- One participant experiences an error and terminates the connection gracefully after sending a problem-report.

### Roles

- Sender: initiates the connection termination.
- Receiver: is notified of the termination.

### Interaction

## Messages

### 1. termination {#termination}

- Type: `iota/termination/0.1/termination`
- Role: [sender](#roles)

Used to inform the [receiver](#roles) that the [sender](#roles) wishes to terminate the established connection. 

#### Structure
```json
{}
```

### 2. termination-response {#termination-response}

- Type: `iota/termination/0.1/termination-response`
- Role: [receiver](#roles)

Response from the [receiver](#roles) that the request to terminate the connection was acknowledged. MUST be sent if the field [`please_ack`](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#acks) is present in the [termination](#termination) message. 

#### Structure
```json
{}
```

## Considerations

This section is non-normative.

- Which party terminates a connection depends on the application but is usually the same as the one that initiated it following a successful interaction to achieve.
- Any party may terminate a connection at any time, even during a protocol.
- A termination message indicates a graceful end to a connection but the underlying transport layer connection could terminate without this message. Implementors should implement reasonable timeouts and reconnection capabilities.
